    <h1 class="h1 text-center">WHY WE MUST HAVE A WEBSITE ?</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <h2 class="h3 hd1">1. Why Are Websites Important? 93% Of Business Purchase Decisions Start With A Search Engine Search of Websites</h2><button class="btn btn-outline-dark btn1">SHOW</button>
      <p class="p1">In order to gain new customers you need to understand where your prospects go when they are looking to find suppliers, research suppliers and make a purchase. In today's world the place where most people in most markets go is to the internet, specifically a search engine like Google, Yahoo, or Bing. These search engines are the big three (in that order) and account for over 90% of all searches. Google is by far the biggest with about 6 of every 10 searches. To learn more about the market share each search engine has go to ComScore.

      </p>
      <p class="p1">Importance of Website: With 93% of business decisions starting with a search engine search that means if you don't have a website, you are only selling to 7% of your market. That is right, you are reducing the potential size of your business by 93%. I would suggest that the same statistic for consumer purchases is lower but still very high, especially for larger ticket items. The larger the item, the more research and shopping people will do. My guess is probably 40-50% of consumer purchases start with an online search. Have a website that will be search engine optimized and designed to drive sales.</p>

      <h3 class="h3 hd2">2. Why Is a Website Important? It Shows Your Professionalism</h3><button class="btn btn-outline-dark btn2">SHOW</button>
      <p class="p2">Another reason why a website is important for your business is that there is a large portion of the market that won't even consider you as an option when they are looking to buy, if you don't have one.  I know personally if I am dealing with a supplier I am looking to purchase from and they don't even have a website I pretty much write them off as an option and my view of that company is diminished. It gives me the impression that it is a company that is very poorly managed.

        With this viewpoint why would I want to purchase from a company like this? Based on my experience most people think similar to myself. There are some people that do not hold this same thought but I would guess that probably 80% of people have bad opinions of companies that don't have websites.
        
        Here's a look at the Profitworks website to give you an idea about how you could promote your business with a professional website.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <h3 class="h3 hd3">3. Why is a Website Important for Your Business? It Gives You Ease Of Access</h3><button class="btn btn-outline-dark btn3">SHOW</button>
      <p class="p3">Having a website makes it very easy for people to find you, read up about your company, discover what you do, and answer a bunch of questions they have on your business. By having a website people will be able to find your company when they search for your company on a search engine like Google, Yahoo or Bing. It is true that if you don't have a website for your business, you may be found in a search engine if you have a listing in a directory, the yellow pages or your business could just automatically show up in a Google places result. Do you really want to leave this to chance though? Plus why not have a website so that you can influence what is displayed about your company and know your website will be listed in addition to having all those other search results. Which of the below results would you rather have for your company. Results like the first image or the last image?

        <p>Everything you see on a website, like buttons, links, animations, and more, were created by a front end web developer. It is the front end developer's job to take the vision and design concept from the client and implement it through code.</p>

        <p>Everything on the page from the logo to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge of the look and feel of the website.

          Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row study-b">
          <p>Just the thought of learning to code can be very intimidating. The word code is mysterious by definition. It implies a technical form of communication that computers, and not humans, are meant to understand.</p>
          <p>One way many people start learning to code is by picking a popular programming language and jumping in head first with no direction. This could take the form of an online coding course, a tutorial project, or a random book purchase on a specific topic.</p>
          <p>Rarely do prospective developers start with a roadmap – a bird's eye view of the coding world that outlines a set of relevant programming concepts, languages, and tools that almost 100% of developers use every day.</p>
          <p>In this article, I propose one such roadmap. I do this by outlining 14 steps – each one discussing an essential concept, language, or tool – that professional developers use to write code, collaborate, and create professional projects.</p>
          <p>I meticulously chose these 14 steps based on my own personal journey learning to code, which spans almost 20 years.</p>
          <p>Part of the reason it took me so long to feel comfortable as a developer is that I would learn about specific topics without a broader context of the coding world.</p>
          <p>Each of the steps in this article discusses a "coding essential" – something that I believe is critical to at least know that it exists at the start of your coding journey.</p>
          <p>One final note before listing the steps in the roadmap: of course reading this article will not make you an expert programmer. It isn't meant to. The purpose of this article is to make you aware that each one of these topics exists, and hopefully give you a basic idea of how each one works so you can build on it intelligently going forward.</p>
